# Axeron Manager (Proof of Concept)

> **Axeron Manager (AxManager)** is a Proof of Concept (POC) for a self-created environment on Android that leverages ADB permissions to provide system-level control. This project explores the idea of creating a persistent, independent ADB-based execution layer within the system.

## 💡 The Concept
This project is a personal exploration into creating a dedicated **ADB Environment** on Android. Instead of just being a simple command runner, AxManager aims to establish a background infrastructure that can host plugins, manage system optimizations, and provide a unified interface for privileged operations—all without requiring full root access (though it can utilize root if available).

## ✨ Features
- 🏗️ **Internal ADB Environment**  
  A self-contained environment designed to maintain and utilize ADB-level privileges.
- 🖥️ **Shell Executor**  
  Run shell commands with persistent sessions.  
  - Supports **ADB / Non-Root execution**.  
  - Optional **Root execution** for enhanced capabilities.  

- ⚡ **Plugin (Unrooted Module)**  
  A system to manage third-party modules within the unrooted environment. [Learn more](https://fahrez182.github.io/AxManager/plugin/what-is-plugin.html)  

- 🌐 **WebUI Interface**  
  Manage and interact with the system environment through a web-based interface.

## 📱 Why this POC?
- **Independence**: Aims to minimize reliance on external PCs for ADB tasks once set up.
- **Environment-centric**: Focuses on creating a resident privileged layer rather than just one-off command execution.
- **Accessibility**: Bringing "Root-like" capabilities to non-rooted devices through native system mechanisms.

## 📖 Roadmap
- [x] Wireless Debugging Activator.
- [x] Command-line / Root Activator.
- [x] Shell Executor basic support (ADB/Non-Root).
- [x] Auto active when use Wireless Debugging (Test)
- [x] [Plugin](https://fahrez182.github.io/AxManager/plugin/what-is-plugin.html) system for third-party extensions.  
- [x] Developer Mode & Advanced Debugging tools.  
- [ ] App optimization based on profiles.

## 🔧 Build & Install
Clone the repository and build using Android Studio or Gradle:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fahrez182/AxManager.git
cd AxManager
./gradlew :manager:assembleDebug
```

Install the manager app to your device via ADB:

```bash
adb install manager/build/outputs/apk/debug/manager-debug.apk
```
